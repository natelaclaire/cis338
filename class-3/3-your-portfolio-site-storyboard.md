# Your Portfolio Site Storyboard

Your assignment for this week is to build a storyboard for your portfolio site using the tool of your choice. Use whatever is easiest for you and remember two very important things:

1. It doesn't matter what it looks like - this is about structure and content, not design
2. Nothing is set in stone - much, if not everything, that you define in your storyboard will be changed as you continue to build the site and that is OK

Microsoft Word, Microsoft PowerPoint, Google Docs, and Google Slides are all good choices for creating your storyboard. You do not need to use Figma - in fact, as I mentioned, it's perhaps not the best tool for this job. If you'd like to use it, though, you are welcome to and it is free for students. Anything else that makes it easy to draw, position, and edit both shapes and text can work as well. For example, Canva, Adobe Illustrator, Microsoft Visio, Miro, Google Drawings, Draw.io, etc.

Whatever you use, I would like you to upload a PDF of the storyboard so that I don't need to know or have the tool that you used.

Remember that your site needs to include multiple pages (at least 5), an image gallery, blog/news posts with multiple categorizations, a contact form, a calendar, a map, a forum, and a shop. Some pages might include multiple items on that list (such as a calendar and map on the same page).
