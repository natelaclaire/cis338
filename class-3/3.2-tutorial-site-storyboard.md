# 3.2 Tutorial Site Storyboard

## Storyboarding the Geekaway Website

Let’s take a look at the **Geekaway tutorial site storyboard**. This storyboard represents the overall structure of the site and includes a set of pages or sections. In total, there are **10 pages/sections**, though some of these may ultimately be combined as the site evolves.

### Tool Used: Figma (FigJam)

This storyboard was created using the **free version of [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)**, specifically a feature called [**FigJam**](https://www.figma.com/figjam/), which functions like a digital whiteboard. FigJam allows you to:

* Add text and visual objects
* Use “stickies” to represent content blocks or ideas
* Group elements together
* Zoom in and out and move around the board easily

Figma is just **one option** for storyboarding—there are many tools you could use—but it works well for quickly laying out ideas.

### Purpose of the Storyboard

At this stage, the goal is **not** to finalize design details. Graphics may change, text may be rewritten, and layouts may evolve. The storyboard is meant to:

* Establish a rough structure
* Visualize content organization
* Explore how users might move through the site

## Page and Section Overview

### Introduction Page

The introduction page includes a small amount of draft introductory text.

---

### Geeky Activities

This section is organized into categories such as:

* **Coding Workshops**, with tiles for different workshop types and introductory text
* **Tech-themed Escape Rooms**, potentially shown as tiles with photos and descriptions

Each tile is envisioned as clickable, leading to a deeper section of the site. The exact layout may change later.

Additional activity categories follow the same tile-based approach.

---

### Less Geeky Activities

This section includes:

* A short explanation of what “less geeky” activities are
* Example activities presented in a similar layout

Again, this reflects a concept rather than a finalized design.

---

### Accommodations

The **Geekaway Accommodations** section includes:

* Tech-themed hotels
* Hacker hostels
* Geeky vacation rentals (larger units)

Basic descriptive text is provided, along with a proposed layout that may change.

---

### Events

The **Events** section is currently envisioned using a tile-based layout, consistent with other areas of the site. This layout is flexible and may be revised later.

---

### Blog

The blog section includes:

* Clickable category filters at the top (e.g., **All Posts**, **What’s Up**, **Geeky News**)
* Blog post tiles arranged in a grid layout

Each blog post tile includes:

* A post image (called a **thumbnail** in WordPress)
* Title
* Date
* Short abstract

---

### Shop

The **Shop** uses a tile-based layout with:

* Item photos
* Item titles

This maintains consistency with other parts of the site.

---

### Geek It Up (Forum)

The **Geek It Up** section is planned as a **private forum**. At this stage:

* The layout is not fully defined
* Forums are complex, and customization often depends on the plugin used

Rather than carefully designing this section, the plan is to:

* Rely mostly on the forum plugin’s built-in layout
* Apply light customization where possible

You *could* include high-level details here, such as:

* Forum categories
* Types of discussions

However, exact layout details are less critical for this section.

---

### Location

The **Location** page includes:

* Address
* Directions (including public transportation)
* A map snapshot

The idea is to clearly show where the business is located.

---

### Contact Us

The **Contact Us** page includes:

* Contact information
* A contact form

The form itself has not been visually laid out yet, but its presence is noted.

---

## Additional Notes on Storyboarding

* Figma can also be used to create **high-fidelity wireframes**, including clickable navigation between pages.
* For this project, we are only using the **basic whiteboarding features**.
* Figma allows the storyboard to be exported as a **PDF**.

Links to both:

* The live Figma storyboard
* The exported PDF

are available in **Brightspace**.

---

## Alternate Storyboard Example

An additional storyboard example is provided for **Monarch Website Design**. This storyboard takes a different approach:

* Each main page appears on its own page in the PDF
* Pages correspond directly to main navigation items
* Each page includes drafted content and layout ideas

While structured differently, it serves the same purpose: visualizing site structure and content.

## Key Takeaway

These two storyboard examples demonstrate different but valid approaches. Together, they should give you a solid idea of how to create a storyboard for your **portfolio site**, which we’ll explore further in the next video.
