# 2.3 Installing WordPress Using cPanel and Softaculous

Let’s take a look at what’s involved in installing WordPress using one of the most popular web hosting control panels: **cPanel**.

cPanel is used by many large and small web hosts, so there’s a good chance you’ll encounter it in real-world work. Installing WordPress through cPanel is very easy, and while this isn’t something you need to do for this class, it’s useful to see how the process works.

---

## The cPanel Dashboard

This is the **cPanel dashboard**. It shows information about your hosting account, such as storage usage, along with all the tools you have access to.

The layout and order of tools may vary from host to host—and even from user to user—because the interface can be customized based on usage.

---

## Softaculous: The App Installer

The tool we use to install WordPress is called **Softaculous**. It’s an app installer that supports many different applications.

If you click into categories like **Portals / CMS**, you’ll see a large directory of free and open-source tools (and possibly some paid tools). Softaculous has been around for a long time and is widely used.

A more recent feature is **WordPress Manager by Softaculous**, which you’ll find under the Software section. You can also search for it using the search bar at the top of cPanel.

---

## WordPress Manager Features

WordPress Manager provides several useful tools:

* Installing WordPress
* One-click sign-in (single sign-on)
* Checking for updates
* Importing an existing WordPress site from another server
* Detecting WordPress installations that were installed manually

Single sign-on is especially convenient. Since you’re already logged into cPanel, you can log directly into WordPress without entering a username and password.

For now, we’re going to focus on the **Install** feature.

---

## Installing WordPress

Click **Install** to begin.

### Installation Location

You’ll choose:

* The **protocol** (use HTTPS)
* The **domain**
* Whether to install WordPress in a **subdirectory**

For this demo, I’m using a secure HTTPS domain and installing WordPress in the root directory. If needed, you could install WordPress in a subdirectory (for example, `/demo`) instead.

### WordPress Version

Always choose the **most recent version of WordPress** unless you have a specific reason not to.

### Site Information

* **Site Name**: This can be anything you want (for example, “Nate’s Demo”).
* **Site Description**: This is the same information WordPress asks for during a normal installation. I’ll leave the default.

You can also choose whether to enable **Multisite**, which we’ll briefly discuss later in the semester.

---

## WordPress Cron Settings

By default, WordPress runs scheduled tasks (called **WP-Cron**) when someone loads a page. This isn’t ideal.

Softaculous lets you disable WP-Cron and instead set up a server-level cron job that runs tasks in the background twice an hour. This improves performance and avoids slowing down page loads.

I recommend enabling this option.

---

## Admin Account Setup

You’ll now create the WordPress admin account:

* **Admin Username**: Do not use `admin`. Choose something unique for security reasons.
* **Password**: Set a strong password.
* **Admin Email**: Use an email address you have access to.

---

## Plugins, Language, and Advanced Options

You can choose to install certain plugins during setup. Some plugins include **Pro versions** that are licensed through the hosting provider.

You can also select the site language.

### Advanced Options

These include:

* **Database name** (automatically generated)
* **Table prefix** (randomized for security)

The table prefix adds security by making database attacks harder, and it also allows multiple WordPress installations to share a single database if needed.

You can also configure:

* Automatic updates for WordPress core, plugins, and themes
* Notification emails for updates
* Backup locations

The default update settings are usually fine. Softaculous will notify you when updates are available and make them easy to apply.

You can also choose to email the installation details to yourself.

Once everything looks good, click **Install**.

---

## After Installation

Once the installation completes, you’ll see links to:

* The WordPress site
* The WordPress admin area

The admin link uses **single sign-on**, so clicking it logs you directly into WordPress.

---

## WordPress Onboarding

When you first log in, WordPress may walk you through a guided onboarding process:

* Categorize the site (for example, business)
* Confirm the site title
* Choose what you want to do with the site

Based on your choices, WordPress may install helpful plugins. For example, an **SMTP email plugin** allows WordPress emails to be sent through a proper email service instead of the default PHP mail function. This helps prevent emails from being marked as spam and is often required by hosting providers.

WordPress may also offer:

* Pre-built themes
* Starter content
* Optional stock images

You can choose to import this content or skip it. If you import images, be aware that while they are generally free to use, you are still responsible for proper usage.

---

## Viewing the Installed Site

After setup:

* Visit the WordPress dashboard
* Refresh the homepage to see the installed theme and content
* Begin making edits as needed

---

## Managing WordPress with Softaculous

Back in **WordPress Manager**, you’ll now see your installed site.

From here, you can:

* Log in with single sign-on
* Manage plugins and themes
* Apply updates
* Create backups
* Restore backups
* Clone the site
* Create a staging environment
* Create templates
* Apply bulk security settings

Softaculous makes managing WordPress installations much easier from the hosting side.

---

## Final Notes

Different hosting providers may use different control panels and tools, but most modern web hosts offer some form of guided WordPress installation.

You typically only need to manually install WordPress when working with custom servers or virtual machines.

If you’re using **cPanel**, I strongly recommend using **Softaculous** for WordPress installations. In my experience, it’s a reliable and efficient option.
