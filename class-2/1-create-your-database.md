# Create Your Database

1. Log into phpMyAdmin with your MySQL username and password at <https://cisstudent.uma.edu/phpmyadmin/>.
2. Click Databases in the top navigation bar
3. Under _Create Database_, enter _cis338tutorial_ after your student account username and an underscore. For example, if your CIS Student Server username is _student2_, your new database name will be _student2_cis338tutorial_. If you already have a database with that name, add a number to the end.
4. Click the _Create_ button.
5. phpMyAdmin will open the database and you will see a message that no tables are found in the database.
6. Repeat the process to create a database for your portfolio site, replacing _cis338tutorial_ with _cis338portfolio_ in step #3.
