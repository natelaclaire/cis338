# 2.1 Installing WordPress Using Local and Configuring WordPress

Today we’re going to talk about installing and configuring WordPress.

You actually already installed a WordPress site last week when we set up the tutorial site as part of installing **Local**. You went through the Local installation process, clicked the **plus (+)** button to add a new site, and installed WordPress during that setup.

One of your tasks today is to repeat that same process, but this time for your **portfolio site**. When you create your portfolio site, you’ll use the name of the site you’re building. That name should be unique to you. This is good practice, and you’ll be able to do it on your own.

If you need help remembering how to install a site, go back to the assignment video from last week and rewatch the section after we finish installing Local. That part walks through how to install WordPress using Local.

I also have other videos this week that show how to install WordPress *without* using a tool like Local. You don’t need to do that for this class, since we’re using Local, but it’s good background information.

## Starting the Site and Accessing WP Admin

We’re going to jump right into configuring WordPress. This is something you’ll need to do for both your **tutorial site**, which we’ll go through together, and your **portfolio site**, which you’ll configure on your own.

I’ve opened Local, and here’s my tutorial site. I need to click **Start Site**. Sometimes Local starts the site automatically, but if you don’t see a green dot next to the site name or you don’t see **Stop Site** at the top, click **Start Site** to get it running.

Last week, I enabled **One-Click Admin**, so when I click **WP Admin**, it takes me directly into the WordPress admin area. If you didn’t enable this, you’ll just be prompted for your username and password. You can still turn on One-Click Admin if you want.

Click **WP Admin** to open the dashboard.

## The WordPress Dashboard

This is the WordPress dashboard. You’ll see some information about your WordPress installation, including the version you’re running. You can dismiss these messages if you want.

The dashboard is fully configurable:

* You can drag boxes around
* Minimize them
* Add or remove boxes

Plugins—and sometimes themes—can add new dashboard widgets. You can also use **Screen Options** at the top to turn specific dashboard boxes on or off.

The **admin bar** appears at the top of every admin page, and the **admin menu** appears on the left-hand side.

## General Settings

We’re going to start by going to **Settings → General**.

### Site Title and Tagline

For the **Site Title**, change it to just **Geekaway**. You don’t need your name here. We included your name in Local to help differentiate student sites, but it doesn’t need to appear on the WordPress site itself.

For the **Tagline**, enter:
**Escape to Geekdom**

### WordPress Address and Site Address

Normally, the **WordPress Address (URL)** and the **Site Address (URL)** are the same.

* The WordPress address is where the WordPress files live.
* The site address is the URL visitors use to access your site.

In more complex setups, WordPress might be installed in a subdirectory (like `/wordpress`), while the site address points to the root domain. You won’t usually see that setup, but that’s the difference between the two fields.

We *do* want to make one change here:
Change both URLs from `http://` to `https://`.

### Administration Email

The administration email address is fine as-is. We’re using **MailPit** to capture emails locally.

### Membership and Roles

Leave **Anyone can register** unchecked for now. We’ll explore that later in the semester.

The **New User Default Role** only applies if users can register, so we can leave it alone.

### Language, Time Zone, and Date Settings

* Leave the site language set to **English (United States)**.
* Change the **Time Zone** to **America → New York**.
  This automatically handles daylight savings time, which is easier than using a UTC offset.
* Leave the date and time formats as-is.
* Change **Week Starts On** from Monday to **Sunday**.

Click **Save Changes**.

## Logging Back In After HTTPS Change

After saving, WordPress will ask you to sign in again. This happens because changing from HTTP to HTTPS invalidates the old cookies.

If you forgot your username, you can find it in Local.

If you forgot your password, click **Lost your password?**, enter your username, and request a reset.

WordPress sends a password reset email. Since we’re working locally:

1. Go back to Local
2. Open **Tools → MailPit**
3. Open the password reset email
4. Click the link and set a new password

Once that’s done, log in again. You’re now logged in using the secure HTTPS URL.

## Other Settings Overview

Let’s briefly look at a few other settings.

### Writing Settings

This page sets defaults for writing content. WordPress also supports posting by email, which has existed for years. We won’t be using that feature, but it’s good to know it exists.

### Reading Settings

We’ll cover these in more detail in a few weeks.

### Discussion Settings

These control comments on blog posts. We’ll also revisit these later.

### Media Settings

Media settings control image sizes. When you upload an image, WordPress automatically creates multiple sizes.

You can change the default sizes here, and plugins can add additional sizes.

There’s also an option to **organize uploads into month- and year-based folders**. Leave this checked.

WordPress stores uploaded files in:

```
wp-content/uploads/
```

Inside that folder, you’ll see year folders, and inside those, month folders. This isn’t perfect organization, but it helps keep things manageable.

WordPress also prevents filename conflicts by automatically renaming files if you upload two files with the same name.

## Permalink Settings

Go to **Settings → Permalinks**.

We’re not going to change anything here, but this is an important setting to understand.

The default option is **Post name**, which creates “pretty URLs” like:

```
/about-us
/sample-post
```

Older WordPress installs used URLs like:

```
?p=123
```

Those weren’t user-friendly or search-engine friendly.

Using **Post name** is best practice and works well for most sites.

Other options let you include:

* Year
* Month
* Day
* Categories

These can be useful if dates are especially important for your content. We’ll talk more about this when we cover blog posts and archives.

The part of the URL after the domain is called the [**slug**](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/what-is-wordpress-slug). You’ll see that term a lot. It’s the unique part of the URL for each page or post.

Leave the permalink structure set to **Post name**.

Behind the scenes, WordPress creates an `.htaccess` file (or equivalent server configuration) that routes all requests through `index.php`. This allows WordPress to handle pretty URLs and display proper 404 pages when content doesn’t exist.

That’s all the settings we’re going to cover for now.
**Privacy settings** are important, but we’ll cover those in a separate video.
