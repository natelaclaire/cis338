# 2.6 Backing Up WordPress Sites in Local

Since we’re talking about backups today, I want to briefly go over how to back up your **WordPress sites in Local**.

In the assignment video, I’ll walk you through creating an **export**. If you’re using Local and don’t want to create a Local account, exporting your site is a great backup option.

To do this, you simply:

1. Click the **ellipsis (⋯)** next to your site
2. Choose **Export**
3. Save the backup file

It’s quick and easy, and it gives you a complete snapshot of your site.

## Local Cloud Backups Add-On

I also want to point out that Local offers a **Cloud Backups** add-on.

You can find it by going to **Add-ons → Cloud Backups**, where you’ll see an explanation of how it works. To use it, you install the add-on by clicking the install button.

This feature requires a **free Local account**.

Once installed:

1. Go to **Tools**
2. Select **Connect Provider**
3. Choose a cloud provider (such as Google Drive or Dropbox)

After connecting a provider, return to your site in Local and click the **Cloud Backups** refresh button. You’ll then be able to back up your site directly to your cloud storage.

## Creating a Cloud Backup

When you start a cloud backup, you can:

* Add a description to the backup
* Choose files and folders to ignore

By default, Local excludes:

* Git-related files
* Cache files
* Yarn configuration files
* The `wp-content/upgrade` folder
* The `wp-content/cache` folder

These folders are rebuilt automatically when needed, so backing them up is unnecessary and can sometimes cause problems when restoring. Excluding them saves space and avoids issues.

Once everything looks good, click **Start Cloud Backup**. Local will create the backup and upload it to a folder in your connected cloud account.

## What You Should Do for This Class

You are **not required** to use Cloud Backups for this course.

You already have:

* **Weekly backups** created when you export your site for submission in Brightspace

Those exports act as snapshots of your site at the end of each week. If you ever need to return to an earlier version, you can restore from one of those files.

If you want extra protection during the week, you can always export your site again at any time. That’s my recommended approach.

## Looking Ahead

It’s useful to know that Local includes cloud backup options, and later on we’ll also talk about **backup plugins** that you can use directly in WordPress.

That’s all for now.
