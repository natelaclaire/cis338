# 2.4 Manually Installing WordPress (Without a Host Installer)

In this video, we’re going to look at how to install WordPress **without** using a web host–provided installer.

To be clear, this is **not something you need to do for this class**. Most hosting providers offer tools that install WordPress for you automatically. However, it’s useful to know how the manual process works in case you ever need it.

You don’t need to follow along. This is a “sit back and watch” video that you can reference in the future.

## Downloading WordPress

To start, go to **WordPress.org** (not WordPress.com).

* **WordPress.com** is a paid, hosted service.
* **WordPress.org** is the open-source project.

On the WordPress.org homepage, click **Get WordPress** (currently located in the upper-right corner, though its location may change).

WordPress partners with many hosting providers to offer installers, and you should always use one if it’s available. Most hosts provide something similar to what we saw earlier with cPanel and Softaculous.

If you don’t have an installer, this manual process is your fallback.

## Two Ways to Install WordPress Files

On the Get WordPress page, you’ll see two main options:

* **Download WordPress**
* **Installation Guide**

We’ll look at two ways to upload WordPress files. Which one you use depends on your server setup and your comfort level.

---

## Method 1: Uploading via SFTP/FTP

Click **Download WordPress**. This downloads a ZIP file.

1. Extract the ZIP file.
2. You’ll get a folder named **wordpress**, which contains all WordPress files.

To upload these files to your host, use an **SFTP or FTPS client** (for example, FileZilla). The exact interface varies, but the concept is the same.

* The **left side** shows your local files.
* The **right side** shows your server files.

Locate the folder where your website files belong. Common names include:

* `public_html`
* `www`

This varies by host, so confirm if you’re unsure.

Once you’re in the correct folder:

* Select all files inside the WordPress folder
* Upload them to the server (drag-and-drop or right-click → upload)

This copies all WordPress files to your hosting account.

---

## Method 2: Installing via SSH (Command Line)

Another option is using **shell access** (SSH), if your host allows it.

From the **Installation Guide**, you’ll see instructions for downloading WordPress directly on the server using `wget`.

1. Log into your server using SSH.
2. Navigate to the directory where your site files should live.
3. Download WordPress:

   ```bash
   wget https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
   ```
4. Extract the archive:

   ```bash
   tar -xvf latest.tar.gz
   ```

This creates a `wordpress` folder containing all WordPress files.

Next, copy the *contents* of that folder into your web root directory (not the folder itself):

```bash
cp -a wordpress/. public_html/
```

The `-a` flag performs an archive copy, preserving hidden files and structure. The `/.` ensures you copy the contents of the folder, not the folder itself.

After that, change into the web root directory and confirm the files are there.

## Running the WordPress Setup

Once the files are in place, open your website’s URL in a browser.

This launches the WordPress setup process:

1. Choose your language
2. Click **Continue**
3. Click **Let’s Go**

WordPress now needs database information to create the `wp-config.php` file.

---

## Database Configuration

You’ll need the following details from your web host:

* Database name
* Database username
* Database password
* Database host (often `localhost`, but not always)

The **table prefix** can be changed. If you only have one WordPress site in the database, it doesn’t strictly matter, but using something slightly different from `wp_` adds a small security benefit.

A simple approach is to add a few numbers (for example, `wp_123_`).

Enter your database details and click **Submit**.

If everything is correct, WordPress will create the configuration file and prompt you to continue.

---

## The Five-Minute Installation

Click **Run the installation**.

You’ll now set:

* **Site Title**
* **Admin Username** (do *not* use `admin`)
* **Admin Password**
* **Admin Email** (use a real, correct address)

If the site is publicly accessible and not ready yet, check the option to **discourage search engines from indexing this site**. This prevents search engines from indexing your site before it’s finished.

Make sure to turn this off later when the site is ready to go live.

Click **Install WordPress**.

Once the process finishes, log in using the username and password you created.

At this point, WordPress is fully installed.

---

## Important Note

The final browser-based setup process is the **same** whether you uploaded files using:

* SFTP/FTP
* SSH

Once the files are in place, the rest of the installation is identical.

---

## A Look at the WordPress Database

Finally, I want to briefly show you what the WordPress database looks like.

Many hosts provide a database administration tool called **phpMyAdmin**.

In phpMyAdmin, you can:

* See the tables created by WordPress (usually around 12 initially)
* Browse table data
* View table structure (fields and types)
* Run SQL queries manually

Most tables will contain minimal or demo data right after installation.

You can also back up your database by:

1. Selecting the database
2. Clicking the **Export** tab
3. Exporting a SQL file

This creates a backup of your database only. It does **not** include WordPress files, themes, or uploads. We’ll talk about file backups separately in another video.

## Final Thoughts

Again, this manual installation process is **not required for this class**, but it’s valuable knowledge to have. In most real-world situations, you’ll use a host-provided installer—but when you can’t, now you know what’s happening under the hood.
