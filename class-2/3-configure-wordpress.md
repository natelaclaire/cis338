# Configure WordPress

1. Go to the URL of your tutorial site following by _wp-login.php_. For example, <https://cisstudent.uma.edu/~studentX/cis338/tutorial/wp-login.php>, where _studentX_ is your CIS Student Server username.
2. Log in using the username and password you created in the _Install WordPress_ tutorial.
3. You will be taken to the _Dashboard_, part of the WordPress _Admin Area_. Down the side you will see a number of sections of the Admin Area in the _Admin Menu_. Along the top, you will see the _Admin Bar_, which provides quick access to the public-facing site and several features. At the far right of the _Admin Bar_, you will see _Howdy, [username]_, which is where you will go to log out, change your password, and configure other options that relate to your WordPress administrative account.
4. In the _Admin Menu_, hover over _Settings_ and click _General_.
5. You will see several settings. To begin, change the tagline to _A place for geeks to be geeks_.
6. In the timezone box, choose _New York_.
7. Click _Save Changes_.
8. In the _Admin Menu_, under _Settings_, click _Permalinks_.
9. By default, WordPress page and post URLs are made up of the URL to the installation with _?p=XXX_ at the end, where _XXX_ is the page/post's internal ID number. For search engine optimization purposes and usability reasons, we want to fix this. Click the radio button next to _Post name_ to indicate that we want the URL to consist of the installation URL followed by a [slug](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/what-is-wordpress-slug) based on the post/page name.
10. Click _Save Changes_.
11. Repeat these steps for your portfolio site.
