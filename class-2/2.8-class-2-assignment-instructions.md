# 2.8 This Week’s Assignment and Submission Process

That wraps up most of this week’s content. There’s just one last thing I want to walk you through: **this week’s assignment**.

By now, you should have watched the videos and followed along with the tutorials using the **tutorial site** we set up in Local last week.

This week was lighter than most. Many of the videos were informational, and you didn’t need to follow along step by step. That won’t be the case most weeks, but these topics were important to cover because they explain what’s happening behind the scenes—especially if you ever work on a platform that doesn’t automate these steps for you.

## What You Need to Do This Week

In addition to working with the tutorial site, you need to complete the following tasks:

### 1. Install Your Portfolio Site

Using **Local**, install a separate copy of WordPress for your **portfolio site**, as discussed in the first video this week.

### 2. Configure Settings on Both Sites

You already configured settings for the tutorial site. Now you should:

* Go through the **Settings** area for the portfolio site as well
* Adjust items such as:

  * Time zone
  * Permalinks
  * Any other settings you feel are appropriate

You may not need to change much, but you should review the settings carefully.

### 3. Add an Instructor User Account

Add a user account for me on **both sites**.

* **Email:** `nathaniel.laclaire@maine.edu`
* **Role:** Administrator

You can copy and paste the email address directly.

I won’t receive the user invitation email because your site is using MailPit, but that’s fine. When I import your site, I’ll use that account and reset the password myself.

## Exporting Your Sites from Local

The final step is to **export both sites from Local** and submit them with the assignment.

### Exporting a Site

1. Click on a site in Local
2. Click the **ellipsis (⋯)**
3. Choose **Export**

You’ll be prompted to exclude certain file types. You likely won’t need to change anything here. The defaults mainly exclude compressed files (like ZIP files), which generally don’t need to be included.

Click **Export Site**, choose where to save the file (for example, your Desktop), and wait for the export process to complete. This may take a few minutes.

Once it finishes, Local will return to normal.

Repeat this process for **both**:

* The tutorial site
* The portfolio site

> Note: The site must be **running** in Local for the export to work.

## Submitting the Assignment in Brightspace

1. Go to **Brightspace**
2. Open the assignment
3. Click **Add a File → My Computer**
4. Upload **both ZIP files**
5. Click **Add**
6. Enter any comments, if needed
7. Click **Submit**

This is the same basic submission process you’ll use most weeks.

## Assignment Comments

You usually won’t need to add comments, but this is a good place to note:

* Anything that was confusing
* Something you’re unsure you did correctly
* Any extra work you completed

Some weeks, I’ll explicitly ask you to include specific comments (for example, explaining which option you chose and why).

---

## Final Notes

Once you submit, Brightspace sends me your ZIP files. I’ll import them into my copy of Local and review your sites.

If you accidentally upload only one file, you can use **Upload More Files**, but make sure both ZIP files are submitted together.

As always, feel free to reach out if you have any questions.
