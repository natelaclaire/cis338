Backing Up Your Site

---

# Use the 3-2-1 rule:

- Keep 3 Copies of Your Data: one on your main machine, and two others, such as a copy on an external hard drive and a copy in cloud storage.
- Use 2 Different Formats: donâ€™t put all of your backups on hard drives or all of them in cloud storage providers.
- Keep 1 Backup Offsite: if a disaster hits your home/office, any backups in your home/office along with your main copy in your computer could be wiped out together. Keep a backup on an external hard drive in a safe deposit box, or keep one backup in the cloud.

# Have A Backup Retention Policy

The actual policy depends on you and the project.

During development, you might keep all backups.

For a live site, you might adopt a more complex policy, such as:

- Keep the most recent 7 daily backups
- Keep the most recent 8 weekly backups
- Keep the most recent 12 monthly backups
