# 11.3 Web Stories

If you use _Google Search_ and/or _Google Discover_ on a mobile device, you probably have seen [_Web Stories_](https://creators.google/en-us/content-creation-products/own-your-content/web-stories/). If you haven't, the concept is similar to _Instagram Stories_, except that _Web Stories_ use only standard Web technologies. _Web Stories_ are short collections of individual frames (usually photo- and video-rich) overlayed with text that can be used to bring people to full pages and posts on your site and, unlike _Instagram Stories_ actually live on your site. Oh, and also unlike _Instagram Stories_, they don't go away after 24 hours unless you decide that's what you want. Feel free to check out the link to understand more, or keep going in this tutorial and all should become clear soon!

1. From the _Admin area_ of your _Tutorial Site_, go to _Plugins > Add New Plugin_.
2. Search for _web stories_ and install and activate the plugin by _Google_.
3. Click _Stories_ on the _Admin menu_.
