# 8.1 Contact Forms

A contact form is an essential element for almost all Web sites. In addition to providing a method for people to contact you, they can also be used for soliciting feedback and collecting leads.

As you might imagine, there are a number of plugins for WordPress that make it easy to build contact forms. One of the oldest and most popular contact form plugins is called [_Contact Form 7_](https://wordpress.org/plugins/contact-form-7/). Remarkably, there is no upgrade option - the plugin is completely free. There are also a number of other free plugins that can add features to _Contact Form 7_. Another very popular contact form plugin is called [_Forminator_](https://wordpress.org/plugins/forminator/), which is by [_WPMU DEV_](https://wpmudev.com/), a company that provides premium plugins and themes as part of a subscription package. While _Contact Form 7_ is super lightweight, fairly flexible, and has a little bit of a learning curve, _Forminator_ comes packaged with many more features, including a drag-and-drop form design tool, support for polls and quizzes, and many integrations, but also places a heavier burden on your Web site because of the size of the plugin and uses a fremium model where some of the features are locked behind a paid upgrade.

After vacillating between the options, I've decided that we are going to use _Forminator_ for this video, but I'm also including an optional tutorial that uses _Contact Form 7_ since it can be a better option if all you need is a simple contact form.
