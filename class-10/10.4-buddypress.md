# 10.4 BuddyPress

If you want to build an online community or social network, _BuddyPress_ is an entirely free and open source plugin from the maintainers of _WordPress_ that is designed for just that purpose. Available at [BuddyPress.org](https://buddypress.org/) or via the _WordPress Plugin Directory_, it provides member profiles, activity streams, user groups to build micro-communities, private messaging, friendship connections, and more. It does not have its own forum system, but _wpForo_ integrates with _BuddyPress_ so that forum activity can be shared to activity streams, forum notifications will go to the _BuddyPress_ notification system, and _wpForo_ will use _BuddyPress_ profiles rather than its own. There are various plugins that extend _BuddyPress_ and it integrates with other popular _WordPress_ plugins such as _Akismet_. _BuddyPress_ can be used with most _WordPress_ themes but there are also many _BuddyPress_-specific themes available.

Although we will not be using _BuddyPress_ in this course, it's important for you to understand that _BuddyPress_ exists, how it can be used, and how it differs from a forum plugin.
