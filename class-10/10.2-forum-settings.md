# 10.2 Forum Settings

_wpForo_ is quite configurable. Let's take a look at some of the options available to us.

1. Go to the _WordPress Admin area_, hover over _wpForo_ on the _Admin menu_, and click _Settings_.
2. There are so many settings! We won't be touching most of these, but I encourage you to peruse the options available as you have time.
3. Let's click _Spam Protection_.
4. A topic is like a thread. When someone asks a question or posts a message that is not a reply to another message, that is a topic. A post is an individual response to a topic, such as a reply or an answer to a question.
5. I recommend leaving the top section as-is, which enables spam control, does not automatically ban users suspected of spamming (leaving this up to manual action), and uses the default suspicion levels. Take a look at the documentation by clicking the question mark icons to learn more about each of the options.
6. The next section allows you to define "new registered user" based on the level of posts and determine how they are treated. You might consider requiring all posts by new users to be manually approved. The default settings don't go that far, but require a user to have posted 3 times before they can edit their profile information or post certain types of files. The final section can be turned on to monitor attachments for possible spam.
7. Click _Save Options_.
8. The plugin also supports using _Google reCAPTCHA_ to protect the _wpForo_ forms and _Akismet_ to scan for spam. We're not going to use these, but just know that they are options that are available. For _Google reCAPTCHA_, you simply need to set up API keys for the version 2 "I'm not a robot" checkbox and provide both the _Site Key_ and _Secret Key_ and then determine which forms will have the _reCAPTCHA_ checkbox. For _Akismet_, you simply need to install and activate the _Akismet_ plugin and then set up your _Akismet_ account. Then just make sure that the toggle here is set to _Yes_ and the rest is automatic.
9. Do you recall that we published the default _Privacy Policy_ page in week 5? We are going to provide a link to both the _Privacy Policy_ page and the _Contact Us_ page on the next settings screen that we look at, so let's grab the URL's for those two pages. Click _Pages_ on the _Admin menu_ and then find the _Contact Us_ page. Hover over _Contact Us_ and then right-click on _View_ and choose _Copy link address_ or the similar option to copy the URL for that page and then paste that somewhere safe for a moment.
10. Scroll down and repeat the process for the _Privacy Policy_ page.
11. Hover over _wpForo_ on the _Admin menu_ and click _Settings_.
12. Click the _Privacy & Forum Rules_ setting page.
13. Paste the URL for the _Contact Us_ page into the _Contact Information_ box.
14. Paste the URL for the _Privacy Policy_ page into the _Page URL to Website Privacy Policy_ box.
15. Click _Yes_ on _Checkbox: I Agree to Forum Privacy Policy_.
16. I strongly encourage you to provide terms of service and require that new users agree to those and also provide forum rules and require that new users agree to those as well. We're not going to do that for the tutorial site, and you aren't required to do so on your portfolio site, but on a production web site those pieces are absolutely essential!
17. Click _Save Options_.
18. Click _Login & Registration_ to go to that settings page.
19. Here are various options relating to allowing new user registrations, requiring email confirmation of new registrations, etc. You can override login and registration forms, set up _Facebook_ login, and make other adjustments. Note that you can require manual approval of new users. Since we are already allowing people to create new accounts without approval for posting blog comments, we won't turn this option on, but it's nice to know that it is available.
20. Next let's take a look at forum permissions. Click _Accesses_ on the _Admin menu_.
21. _Forum Accesses_ are sets of permissions and you can see that you have granular control over the permissions provided to each _Access_.
22. Click _Usergroups_ on the _Admin menu_.
23. These are groups of users and how they relate to the _WordPress_ user roles, both those that are built-in and those that are added by other plugins. You can create a usergroup to associate with a user role using the second table.
24. Notice in the first table, you can easily see the members assigned to a usergroup and change the associated user role.
25. We're going to set up a special usergroup for current and past guests and allow only them to participate in the _Geekaway Friends_ category. Click _Add New_.
26. For the _Usergroup Name_, enter _Geekaway Friend_.
27. Leave the _User Role_ as _Subscriber_.
28. Uncheck _Display on Members List_ and check _Can be also userd as Secondary Usergroup_.
29. Select a shade of green for the _Usergroup Color_.
30. Click _Save_.
31. Click _Forums_ in the _Admin menu_.
32. Click _Edit_ next to _Geekaway Friends_.
33. Take a look at the _Forum Permissions_ box. This allows you to determine which usergroup has which access for this forum. Change _Registered_ and _Guest_ to _No access_ and _Geekaway Friend_ to _Standard access_.
34. Click _Update_ and then make the same change for the two forums within the _Geekaway Friends_ category.
