# 4.8 Optional: Classic Theme Customization

In recent tutorials, we’ve focused on customizing themes using Full Site Editing (FSE). Many WordPress themes, however, are still what are known as *classic themes*. These do not support Full Site Editing.

While I strongly recommend using Full Site Editing themes when possible—because they offer more flexibility and consistency—you may find a classic theme that you really like. If that happens, don’t worry. You can still complete almost all of the course work without any issues.

This walkthrough gives you a high-level overview of how classic theme customization works and what to expect.

---

## How to Tell If a Theme Supports Full Site Editing

You can usually tell whether a theme supports Full Site Editing by looking at the **Appearance** menu in the WordPress admin area.

* Classic themes typically show options like **Customize**, **Widgets**, **Menus**, and **Theme File Editor**.
* Full Site Editing themes include **Editor** (sometimes called *Site Editor*).

Some themes support a mix of both. If you see a Site Editor option, click into it and check whether it behaves like what we’ve covered with Full Site Editing. If it does, you’re good to go.

---

## The Customizer Interface

Classic themes are customized using the **Customizer** tool. This tool provides:

* A live preview of your site
* Responsive previews for desktop, tablet, and mobile
* The ability to publish, save drafts, or schedule changes

The exact options available will vary widely from theme to theme. Theme developers can enable, disable, or extend features within the Customizer, so expect some variation.

Over time, you’ll start to recognize common patterns, even though each theme may organize things a bit differently.

---

## Site Identity

One standard section you’ll almost always see is **Site Identity**. This is where you can:

* Set the site title
* Upload a logo
* Control whether the title and tagline are displayed
* Set a site icon (often called a favicon)

The site icon appears in browser tabs, bookmarks, and sometimes on mobile home screens.

---

## Theme-Specific Sections

Many classic themes add their own custom sections. For example, this theme includes a **Home Page Hero Area**, which allows you to:

* Set a background image or video
* Change the headline text and description

These sections are entirely theme-specific and won’t appear in all themes.

---

## Typography

Typography settings are often included, though they can be limited or expanded depending on the theme. Typical options include:

* Font selection
* Font size adjustments
* Styling for specific areas like logos or menus

Changes are reflected immediately in the live preview, which makes experimentation easy.

---

## Colors

Color controls are another common feature. Depending on the theme, you may be able to:

* Choose from preset color schemes
* Customize colors for headers, menus, hero areas, and footers

Again, the exact controls depend on what the theme author has provided.

---

## Layout Options

Some themes include layout controls for different templates, such as:

* Blog pages
* Single post pages

These options might let you choose between full-width layouts or layouts with sidebars. Not all themes include this, and the options are usually specific to the theme.

---

## Menus

Menu customization is handled here as well, but we’ll be focusing on menus in more detail next week. For now, it’s best not to spend too much time adjusting menus unless you’re comfortable doing so.

---

## Widgets and Sidebars

Widgets are a major part of customizing classic themes.

Widgets allow you to add content to areas like:

* Sidebars
* Footers
* Headers
* Front-page widget areas

Modern themes often let you use blocks inside widget areas, which helps bridge the gap between classic and block-based editing.

The term *sidebar* comes from the original use of these areas on the left or right side of the page, but today widget areas can appear almost anywhere.

As you add widgets, WordPress shows visual indicators that let you edit each widget area directly from the preview.

---

## Homepage Settings

Homepage Settings allow you to choose whether your site displays:

* A list of recent posts
* A specific static page as the homepage

This is another way to control the same setting we’ve discussed in earlier theme tutorials.

---

## Additional CSS

The **Additional CSS** section allows you to write custom CSS that overrides the theme’s styles.

Before Full Site Editing, this was the primary way to customize a theme’s appearance. It’s still useful for advanced tweaks or styles that aren’t available through the Customizer interface.

---

## Publishing, Drafts, and Scheduling Changes

When you make changes in the Customizer, you can:

* Publish them immediately
* Save them as a draft
* Schedule them to go live at a future time

Saving drafts is especially useful if your site is live and you’re not ready for visitors to see incomplete changes.

You can also generate a preview link from a draft and share it with others—such as a client or collaborator—for feedback before publishing.

---

## Theme File Editor and Child Themes

The **Theme File Editor** allows direct editing of a theme’s files, including CSS, PHP, and HTML. This is generally **not recommended**.

Direct edits can be overwritten when the theme updates, which creates maintenance and security issues.

Instead, WordPress introduced **child themes**, which we discussed earlier and allow you to customize a theme safely without modifying the original theme files.

---

## Final Notes

Classic theme customization can vary significantly from one theme to another. Your experience may differ, and that’s normal.

If you run into issues or aren’t sure how to accomplish something with your chosen theme, feel free to reach out. I’m happy to take a look and help you work through it.

Have a great week.
