# 9.4 Optional Tutorial: Local Development

In this tutorial we are going to talk about site development workflow and in specific about a tool that can help you build WordPress sites on your local machine. So far in this course we have been using a workflow that involves a development server that is located in the cloud. In an ideal Web development situation, you have at least three separate environments:

1. Your development environment is configured with development-specific tools and settings and, as you might guess, is where your actual development work takes place. Depending on the size of your team and the specifics of a particular project, you may find yourself using multiple development environments, such as one local environment that you use to work on things that you are solely responsible for and another cloud-based development environment that everyone shares and where you place work that you are ready to share. That's especially true if you are developing custom themes and/or plugins since when it comes to page content or doing stuff with FSE, the process of migrating changes between your local environment and a development server is cumbersome.
2. Your production environment is where your site gets deployed when it's ready to be used. It doesn't include the development tools and settings, and instead is configured to improve performance and security, such as using caching technologies, disabling error reporting, and using a Web application firewall.
3. Your staging environment is meant to mimic your production environment, but is used as a final testing location before the site is deployed to production. The idea is that after all other testing has been performed, you need to ensure that the site is going to run smoothly in the production environment before actually deploying it there. If you accidentally built in a dependency on something that is used purely in the development environment and not in production, if a change that you implemented causes bottlenecks with a caching product you are using, or if the site is now going to depend on a new technology that will need to be installed on the production server, it should be caught when you migrate to staging so that deploying to production is seamless.

In this video we are going to be focusing on the development environment, but I wanted to share that little bit about how this fits in a typical workflow.

The tool that I want to share with you is called [Local](https://localwp.com/) and is available at <localwp.com>. It is a free tool from [WP Engine](https://wpengine.com/about-us/), a large WordPress-specific hosting provider that also produces some popular WordPress plugins. The tool is designed to make it easy for you to set up a local development environment for your WordPress project. As you might expect, the tool also makes it easy to deploy that site to WP Engine's own services, but it works great even if you don't use WP Engine.

Let's install Local and walk through how to use it. Go to <localwp.com> and click _Download_ and then choose your own platform. This will download the installer to your computer. Pause the video while you download and install it and then continue when you have launched Local.
