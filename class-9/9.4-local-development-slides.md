# Development Environment

- Configured with development-specific tools and settings
- Where your actual development work takes place

---

# Production Environment

- Where your site gets deployed when it's ready to be used
- Doesn't include the development tools and settings
- Configured to improve performance and security, such as using caching technologies, disabling error reporting, and using a Web application firewall

---

# Staging Environment

- Meant to mimic your production environment
- Used as a final testing location before the site is deployed to production
- Used to make sure that your site will run smoothly when you deploy to production
- *Should be set up exactly the same as production!*
