# 6.8 AI Tools

With the growth of generative artificial intelligence, no discussion of creating site content would be complete without at least touching on it. Many people are using generative AI to produce their content or at least draft their content. Large language models such as ChatGPT can provide impressive verbiage, even if it at times is completely inaccurate, and image models such as DALL-E produce remarkable images, even though at times they defy reality. Over the past year or so, numerous tools have popped up that leverage AI for search engine optimization purposes. We'll discuss those more when we cover SEO, but for now let's look specifically at content creation using AI.

I'm going to install and demonstrate an AI plugin, but I won't have you follow along as this requires purchasing credits from OpenAI.

When I go to _Plugins_, you can see that I've installed a plugin called _AI Engine_. It has many active installations, high reviews, and it allows me to connect to my own OpenAI account via OpenAI's API and use ChatGPT and DALL-E, rather than requiring me to purchase a separate service from the plugin author.

After installing the plugin, I went to the plugin settings and provided my OpenAI API key. The settings page doesn't mask the API key that I entered, so I won't show that page. I was also able to choose which LLM's I wanted to use, so I chose ChatGPT 4 (the latest version) and DALL-E 3 HD. There are a number of other settings available, but I'll leave it to you to learn more about those if you decide to try this out at some point. On this page, I was able to turn on the features that I wanted. I was primarily interested in the _Content Generator_ and _Images Generator_.

Once configured, the AI Engine tools are found in two places. Under _Posts_ there is a new _Generate New_ option for creating blog posts. Under _Tools_ that same page is listed as _Generate Content_ and there is also _Generate Images_.

I'll demonstrate generating images with one of the template prompts. AI prompt writing has become a job of its own and I know very little about it, so I'm going to rely on experts for this demo. I select the template and/or enter/modify the prompt and then click _Generate_. After several seconds, I get my result. I can click it to add it to my _Media Library_. Note that you may choose to generate several variants and you need to click and save each one that you want to keep. I can then go to my _Media Library_ and confirm that it was added.

The _Content Generator_ allows me to enter a topic or use a predefined template and AI Engine will ask ChatGPT to provide a title that relates to that topic, come up with sections based on the title, build content to fill the sections, and create an excerpt of the content. Or, I can choose my own title and have ChatGPT provide the sections, write my own title and sections and have ChatGPT provide the content, and so on. I can set the language, writing style, and writing tone. Once the content is generated, I can choose whether to make this a page or post or some other type of WordPress content and then create it and AI Engine saves it as a draft so that I can make changes and publish. I'm going to choose a title of _The three best places to visit in Maine_ and have it generate 3 sections. I can modify the sections if I want and then click generate content. I can modify the content or change the sections and re-generate the content. Finally, I can generate an Excerpt and save the post as a draft. Now I can go to _Posts_ and make whatever changes I want before publishing.

Speaking of posts, next week we will be talking about blogging!
