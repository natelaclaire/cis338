# Image Sliders

Similar to a slide show, an image slider is a Web site element that displays one image or video at a time with the image/video being replaced by another either after a set amount of time or when the visitor clicks to view the next slide. Often image sliders also include text, either superimposed on the image/video or appearing next to the image/video. WordPress doesn't natively provide an image slider block, but there are a number of image slider plugins available. We're going to install one called _Soliloquy_.

1. From the _Admin area_ of your tutorial site, go to _Plugins > Add New Plugin_.
2. Search for _Soliloquy_.
3. Find _Slider by Soliloquy â€“ Responsive Image Slider for WordPress_.
4. Click _Install Now_.
5. Click _Activate_.

Now that it is installed _Soliloquy_ has its own section on the _Admin menu_. Click it to take a look. There is no need to upgrade to Pro for this course - the Lite version provides everything that we need! If you find that you like it and use it on a published site, perhaps consider then if you want to support the plugin financially and/or if you need the features only offered in the Pro version.

1. Click _Add New_ to add a new slider.
2. Add a title of _Home page slider_.
3.
