# 6.2.5 Image Editing and Generated Image Sizes in WordPress

In this walkthrough, we’ll look at two things:

1. The built-in image editing tools in WordPress
2. What happens behind the scenes when you upload an image

Understanding both will help you make better decisions about image size, performance, and layout.

## What Happens When You Upload an Image

When you upload an image to the Media Library, WordPress stores the full-size version that was imported.

For example:

* If you upload an image that is 600 × 400 pixels, WordPress saves that exact version as the full-size image.
* If you import an image from a source like Unsplash (using a tool such as Instant Images), WordPress downloads the largest version that fits within your configured maximum dimensions.

That imported version becomes the “full size” image inside WordPress. It may not be the original image from the photographer, but it is the original version stored in your site.

## Editing Images in the Media Library

Each image in the Media Library includes an **Edit Image** option. This opens a basic editing interface with several tools.

### Cropping

You can crop an image visually by dragging the crop handles. Once you’re satisfied with the selection, apply the crop and then save your edits.

You can also:

* Manually enter crop coordinates
* Lock the crop to a specific aspect ratio (for example, 16:9)

If you don’t save your edits after applying a crop, the change will be lost when you move on to something else.

---

### Scaling

You can scale an image by entering a new width. WordPress automatically maintains the aspect ratio and adjusts the height proportionally.

For example, if an image starts at 1600 pixels wide and you change it to 1000 pixels wide, WordPress recalculates the height to maintain the correct proportions.

---

### Rotation and Undo

You can rotate images and undo recent changes. If needed, you can also restore the image back to its original uploaded version.

Always remember to save your edits when you’re done. You can cancel editing at any time to revert to the last saved version.

## Multiple Image Sizes: What WordPress Generates Automatically

When you upload an image, WordPress automatically creates multiple additional versions of that image at different sizes.

By default, WordPress generates:

* Thumbnail (typically 150 × 150 pixels)
* Medium size (maximum width and height defined in settings)
* Large size (maximum width and height defined in settings)

Depending on the original image dimensions, WordPress may also generate additional intermediate sizes.

### Important Details

* The **thumbnail** size is usually cropped to exact dimensions.
* The **medium** and **large** sizes are scaled proportionally and maintain the original aspect ratio.
* If the original image is smaller than a defined size, WordPress will not generate a larger version.

For example, if an image is wider than 768 pixels, WordPress may generate a version that is 768 pixels wide. If it is wider than 1024 pixels, it may also generate a 1024-pixel-wide version.

All of these versions are stored in the `wp-content/uploads` directory, organized by year and month.

## Why Multiple Sizes Matter

These additional image sizes are used for responsive images.

When a browser loads a page, WordPress provides multiple versions of the image. The browser then selects the most appropriate version based on:

* Screen size
* Device resolution
* Available bandwidth

This helps balance image quality and performance.

We’ll look more closely at how responsive images work in a future lesson.

## Where Image Sizes Are Configured

WordPress allows you to control the three default image sizes under:

**Settings → Media**

There, you can define:

* Thumbnail width and height
* Medium maximum width and height
* Large maximum width and height

There is also an option to force thumbnails to crop to exact dimensions rather than scaling proportionally.

---

## Themes and Plugins Can Change Image Sizes

In addition to the default sizes:

* Themes can define their own custom image sizes.
* Plugins can add or override image sizes.

So even if you don’t install a specific image-sizing plugin, your theme may still be generating additional image variations behind the scenes.

The exact sizes created on your site may differ depending on your theme and active plugins.

---

## Final Thoughts

WordPress handles a lot of image optimization automatically by:

* Generating multiple scaled versions
* Serving responsive images
* Allowing basic editing inside the Media Library

Understanding how this works helps you make better decisions about image dimensions, performance, and layout.
