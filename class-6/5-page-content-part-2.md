# Page Content, Part 2

Open the _Normie Activities_ page. Notice the photo that appears behind the page title. This is the _Featured Image_ for the page. Let's change it to something else for this page.

1. Click _Edit Page_ on the _Admin bar_.
2. On the _Page_ tab of the _Settings_ pane, expand _Featured Image_ and then click _Set Featured Image_.
3. Use _Instant Images_ to find a photo of happy people.
4. Once the photo has been downloaded, click _Set featured image_.
5. Click _Update_ and view the page.

Oops! Our theme _isn't_ using the _Featured Image_ at the top of the pages after all... Well, fortunately, we have _Full Site Editing_!

1. Click _Edit Site_ on the _Admin bar_.
2. The _Pages_ template loads in the _Full Site Editor_. Click the _Edit_ button.
3. Click the photo behind the word _Title_.
4. Hey - it's a _Cover_ block! We know how to work with these! Click _Replace_ on the block popover, but instead of clicking _Open Media Library_ or _Upload_, click _Use featured image_.
5. Because we are editing a generic template, there is no featured image to pull so we get just a gray box. No worries - that's what should happen! Click _Save_ and _Save_ again.
6. Click the WordPress icon to _Open Navigation_ and view the site.
7. Return to _Normie Activities_ to see our _Featured Image_ in place.

Let's add some more content to this page.

1. Click _Edit Page_.
2. Paste the introductory text from the Geekaway Starter Content document into the top of the page.
3. Add the _Outdoor Adventures_ heading and content from the document, using the 50/50 columns and _Four Activities_ pattern. Within each of the covers, add a paragraph block for the additional text and set the font size to Tiny. Note that the cover expands to fit the text.

Click the _Add block_ button below what you just added and then click _Browse_ to see all of the blocks, patterns, and media available to add. Explore the various blocks and feel free to try out different ones. You can read more about the different blocks using the links in this tutorial's resource list. Notice that there is a _Code_ block for showing code on a page and a _Custom HTML_ block for entering HTML that will then be translated by the browser, in case you have pre-built HTML and can't or don't want to replicate it using the block editor. Also notice all of the _Embed_ options.

Click one of the _Paragraph_ blocks. Some blocks, including _Paragraph_ allow you to edit the HTML. Click the _Options_ button and choose _Edit as HTML_ to see the code behind that block. Try adding some HTML, such as making something bold, and then click _Edit Visually_ to see the result.

You can also switch to a _Code Editor_ to edit the code for the entire page. This is especially useful if something has gotten messed up on the page and you can't easily move things around to correct the situation. To access the _Code Editor_, click the _Options_ button for the editor and choose _Code Editor_. As someone with HTML experience, reading the code may give you some insight into how blocks are created. WordPress uses special comment tags that sometimes contain JSON notation to identify blocks and their settings and then between the opening and closing comment tags for each block you will see the actual HTML for that block. Be careful, though - it's easy to make a mistake if you don't know what you are doing and that can lead to having to rebuild the page or rollback to a prior version using the _Revisions_ tool. Use the _Options_ button to return to the _Visual Editor_.

There's more that we could do here, but for now, let's save the page.
