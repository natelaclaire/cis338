# 7.10 Optional Tutorial: Google reCAPTCHA

Many plugins that provide a CAPTCHA option rely on [_Google reCAPTCHA_](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/). If you find yourself needing to set up Google reCAPTCHA, here is some information that might help:

- _Label_ - this is completely for your reference and can be whatever makes the most sense to you.
- _reCAPTCHA type_ - you'll need to choose the type that the plugin requires; some plugins might give you the option, in which case you need to make sure that you choose the same option in reCAPTCHA and in the plugin. Clicking the _i_ icon takes you to a page that provides more detail about the types.
- _Domains_ - this should be just the domain name, not the full URL to your site. That means that for the CIS student server, you should place _cisstudent.uma.edu_ in this box. If you place anything other than that, such as the protocol (e.g. _https://cisstudent.uma.edu_) or path (e.g. _https://cisstudent.uma.edu/~student2/cis338/_), it will not work.
