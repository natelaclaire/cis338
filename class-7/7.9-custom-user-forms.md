# 7.9 Optional Tutorial: Custom User Forms

Now that you are requiring people to register for your site to do things like comment on posts, you may find yourself wanting to customize the fields displayed on the registration form and profile page. There are a number of plugins that allow you to do this. Some of those plugins customize the default forms provided by WordPress. Others create completely separate forms.

One popular plugin that creates completely separate forms and also provides an optional member directory is [_Ultimate Member_](https://ultimatemember.com/). If you'd like to explore such plugins, I encourage you to check out a few and see the differences.

Instead of using a pre-existing plugin, we're going to create our own. It's a very simple plugin, but it will give us a taste of how plugins are created.

1. Create a folder called _geekaway-plugin_.
2. Inside, create a file named _geekaway-plugin.php_.
3. Remember that when creating themes or plugins in WordPress you always place an opening PHP tag at the top of the file and never put a closing tag at the bottom. Here's the code to place in the file:

```php
<?php
/**
* Plugin Name: geekaway-plugin
**/

// First, let's add First Name and Last Name to the registration form. 
// First Name and Last Name are default user meta fields in WordPress, but they aren't 
// usually on the registration form.
add_action( 'register_form', 'geekawayplugin_register_form' );
function geekawayplugin_register_form() {

    $first_name = ( ! empty( $_POST['first_name'] ) ) ? sanitize_text_field( $_POST['first_name'] ) : '';
    $last_name = ( ! empty( $_POST['last_name'] ) ) ? sanitize_text_field( $_POST['last_name'] ) : '';
        
    ?>
    <p>
        <label for="first_name"><?php _e( 'First Name', 'geekawayplugin' ) ?><br />
            <input type="text" name="first_name" id="first_name" class="input" value="<?php echo esc_attr(  $first_name  ); ?>" size="25" /></label>
    </p>
    <p>
        <label for="last_name"><?php _e( 'Last Name', 'geekawayplugin' ) ?><br />
            <input type="text" name="last_name" id="last_name" class="input" value="<?php echo esc_attr(  $last_name  ); ?>" size="25" /></label>
    </p>
    <?php
}

// We'll make the first and last name fields required, so we need to validate them.
add_filter( 'registration_errors', 'geekawayplugin_registration_errors', 10, 3 );
function geekawayplugin_registration_errors( $errors, $sanitized_user_login, $user_email ) {
    
    if ( empty( $_POST['first_name'] ) || ! empty( $_POST['first_name'] ) && trim( $_POST['first_name'] ) == '' ) {
        $errors->add( 'first_name_error', sprintf('<strong>%s</strong>: %s',__( 'ERROR', 'geekawayplugin' ),__( 'You must include a first name.', 'geekawayplugin' ) ) );
    }
    if ( empty( $_POST['last_name'] ) || ! empty( $_POST['last_name'] ) && trim( $_POST['last_name'] ) == '' ) {
        $errors->add( 'last_name_error', sprintf('<strong>%s</strong>: %s',__( 'ERROR', 'geekawayplugin' ),__( 'You must include a last name.', 'geekawayplugin' ) ) );
    }

    return $errors;
}

// Finally, let's save the data.
add_action( 'user_register', 'geekawayplugin_user_register' );
function geekawayplugin_user_register( $user_id ) {
    if ( ! empty( $_POST['first_name'] ) ) {
        update_user_meta( $user_id, 'first_name', sanitize_text_field( $_POST['first_name'] ) );
    }
    if ( ! empty( $_POST['last_name'] ) ) {
        update_user_meta( $user_id, 'last_name', sanitize_text_field( $_POST['last_name'] ) );
    }
}
```

4. Once you've saved the file, you need to upload it inside its own folder to your tutorial site's _/wp-content/plugins/_ folder.
5. During development, you would generally upload the folder using SFTP because it simplifies the process of testing and iteration. Then you just need to go to _Plugins > All Plugins_ and click _Activate_. At that point, if you make changes, all you need to do is re-upload the file.
6. Let's load the registration form and confirm that we can see the new fields.
7. Try creating an account and verify that the first name and last name fields save successfully.
8. This is cool, but what if we want to add a new user meta field that isn't a default field provided by WordPress? Let's add a _Favorite Color_ field. Because it isn't already on the _User Profile_ page, we'll need to add it there, too. Below is the final code for the plugin, but in the video I show what we need to modify rather than copying and pasting the whole thing.

```php
<?php
/**
* Plugin Name: geekaway-plugin
**/

// First, let's add First Name, Last Name, and Favorite Color to the registration form. 
// First Name and Last Name are default user meta fields in WordPress, but they aren't 
// usually on the registration form. Favorite Color is a custom user meta field.
add_action( 'register_form', 'geekawayplugin_register_form' );
function geekawayplugin_register_form() {

    $first_name = ( ! empty( $_POST['first_name'] ) ) ? sanitize_text_field( $_POST['first_name'] ) : '';
    $last_name = ( ! empty( $_POST['last_name'] ) ) ? sanitize_text_field( $_POST['last_name'] ) : '';
    $favorite_color = ( ! empty( $_POST['favorite_color'] ) ) ? sanitize_text_field( $_POST['favorite_color'] ) : '';
        
    ?>
    <p>
        <label for="first_name"><?php _e( 'First Name', 'geekawayplugin' ) ?><br />
            <input type="text" name="first_name" id="first_name" class="input" value="<?php echo esc_attr(  $first_name  ); ?>" size="25" /></label>
    </p>
    <p>
        <label for="last_name"><?php _e( 'Last Name', 'geekawayplugin' ) ?><br />
            <input type="text" name="last_name" id="last_name" class="input" value="<?php echo esc_attr(  $last_name  ); ?>" size="25" /></label>
    </p>
    <p>
        <label for="favorite_color"><?php _e( 'Favorite Color', 'geekawayplugin' ) ?><br />
            <input type="text" name="favorite_color" id="favorite_color" class="input" value="<?php echo esc_attr(  $favorite_color  ); ?>" size="25" /></label>
    </p>
    <?php
}

// We'll make the first and last name fields required, so we need to validate them.
add_filter( 'registration_errors', 'geekawayplugin_registration_errors', 10, 3 );
function geekawayplugin_registration_errors( $errors, $sanitized_user_login, $user_email ) {
    
    if ( empty( $_POST['first_name'] ) || ! empty( $_POST['first_name'] ) && trim( $_POST['first_name'] ) == '' ) {
        $errors->add( 'first_name_error', sprintf('<strong>%s</strong>: %s',__( 'ERROR', 'geekawayplugin' ),__( 'You must include a first name.', 'geekawayplugin' ) ) );
    }
    if ( empty( $_POST['last_name'] ) || ! empty( $_POST['last_name'] ) && trim( $_POST['last_name'] ) == '' ) {
        $errors->add( 'last_name_error', sprintf('<strong>%s</strong>: %s',__( 'ERROR', 'geekawayplugin' ),__( 'You must include a last name.', 'geekawayplugin' ) ) );
    }

    return $errors;
}

// Finally, let's save the data.
add_action( 'user_register', 'geekawayplugin_user_register' );
function geekawayplugin_user_register( $user_id ) {
    if ( ! empty( $_POST['first_name'] ) ) {
        update_user_meta( $user_id, 'first_name', sanitize_text_field( $_POST['first_name'] ) );
    }
    if ( ! empty( $_POST['last_name'] ) ) {
        update_user_meta( $user_id, 'last_name', sanitize_text_field( $_POST['last_name'] ) );
    }
    if ( ! empty( $_POST['favorite_color'] ) ) {
        update_user_meta( $user_id, 'favorite_color', sanitize_text_field( $_POST['favorite_color'] ) );
    }
}

// Now, let's add the Favorite Color field to the user profile page. The First Name 
// and Last Name are already on the profile page by default.
// show_user_profile only triggers when a user is viewing their own profile page.
// edit_user_profile only triggers when an admin is editing a user's profile page.
add_action( 'show_user_profile', 'geekawayplugin_profile_fields' );
add_action( 'edit_user_profile', 'geekawayplugin_profile_fields' );

function geekawayplugin_profile_fields( $user ) { ?>
    <h3><?php _e("Additional Information", "blank"); ?></h3>

    <table class="form-table">
    <tr>
        <th><label for="favorite_color"><?php _e("Favorite Color"); ?></label></th>
        <td>
            <input type="text" name="favorite_color" id="favorite_color" value="<?php echo esc_attr( get_the_author_meta( 'favorite_color', $user->ID ) ); ?>" class="regular-text" /><br />
            <span class="description"><?php _e("Please enter your favorite color."); ?></span>
        </td>
    </tr>
    </table>
<?php }

// Now, let's save the Favorite Color when the user profile page is saved.
// personal_options_update only triggers when a user is saving their own profile page.
// edit_user_profile_update only triggers when an admin is saving a user's profile page.
add_action( 'personal_options_update', 'geekawayplugin_save_profile_fields' );
add_action( 'edit_user_profile_update', 'geekawayplugin_save_profile_fields' );

function geekawayplugin_save_profile_fields( $user_id ) {
    if ( empty( $_POST['_wpnonce'] ) || ! wp_verify_nonce( $_POST['_wpnonce'], 'update-user_' . $user_id ) ) {
        return;
    }
    
    if ( !current_user_can( 'edit_user', $user_id ) ) { 
        return false; 
    }
    update_user_meta( $user_id, 'favorite_color', $_POST['favorite_color'] );
}
```

9. Upload the geekaway-plugin.php file again.
10. Edit your profile and confirm that you see the _Favorite Color_ field and that what you enter into the field gets saved.
11. Edit the profile for the _instructor_ account and verify that the field appears there as well and that what you enter into the field gets saved.
12. Go back to the registration form to confirm that all three of the new fields appear there now. Try creating a new account and filling in all of those fields. Once you've done that, check to see if the information saved to your profile.
13. Now that the plugin is working, if you wanted to distribute this there would be one more step: packaging it for distribution. We should test our distribution-ready .zip file after we build it, so let's do some preparation work for that. Go to _Plugins > All Plugins_ and deactivate and then delete the new plugin.
14. Now zip the entire folder into a file called _geekaway-plugin.zip_. That's all that we need to do to package our plugin.
15. Go to the _Admin area_, _Plugins > Add New Plugin_ on the _Admin menu_, and click the _Upload Plugin_ button.
16. Click _Browse_, select the .zip file, click _Install Now_, and then _Activate_.
17. Now check the user profile form to confirm that the _Favorite Color_ field still appears with a value.

Wait - we deactivated the plugin and then reactivated it and the custom user meta field value is still there? Yes, WordPress doesn't do any automatic clean-up when you deactivate a plugin. Meta data continues to remain in the WordPress database unless you remove it. Plugin developers (like you!) can use a hook to clean up after themselves on deactivation, but it's not uncommon for people to deactivate plugins and then reactivate them (and doing so is very easy, as you know), so the best practice is to provide a tool for cleaning up data prior to deactivation rather than assuming that anyone who deactivates your plugin wants their data removed. Imagine if you create a plugin that is installed on a site where it collects data on many thousands of users and the site owner accidentally deactivates it. They reactivate it and discover that the plugin automatically deleted all of that data. Not good! You thought you were being a good developer and not cluttering up a database, but that's likely not how they would see it. So, instead, offer a button with lots of warnings and confirmations that deletes all of your plugin's data. You can even place a link next to the _Deactivate_ link that takes people to that process in order to highlight the fact that you provide it. We won't go into how to do that here, but I encourage you to look into it if you are interested!
