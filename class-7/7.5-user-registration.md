# 7.5 User Registration

As we discussed, one way to protect your site from comment spam is to require registration to comment. If we turn on that option, we will also want to enable registrations for our site; otherwise, we would only be allowing comments from people for whom we have created accounts.

Let's set this up.

1. On the _Admin bar_, go to _Settings > Discussion_, check _Users must be registered and logged in to comment_, and click _Save Changes_.
2. Next, go to _Settings > General_, check _Anyone can register_, and click _Save Changes_. Note that the default role is _Subscriber_, which is a role that has no administrative rights (check [WordPress Roles and Capabilities](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/roles-and-capabilities/) for more information), which is what we want.
3. Remember that _WP Armour_ is already protecting your registration form using a honeypot. Additionally, as part of the registration process, new users must receive an email, which further protects the form. Let's add a new CAPTCHA plugin to further protect the registration form. Remember that we have the CAPTCHA from _BulletProof Security_ that is protecting the login form, but it isn't protecting the registration form.
