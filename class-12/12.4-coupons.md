# 12.4 Coupons

_WordPress Simple Shopping Cart_ has basic support for coupons. Let's set one up!

1. In the _Admin area_, go to _Simple Cart > Coupons_ on the _Admin menu_.
2. We first need to add the _Enter Coupon Code_ box to the shopping cart. To do that, check _Enable Discount Coupon Feature_ and click _Update_.
3. In the _Coupon Code_ box, type _hype_.
4. In the _Discount Rate (%)_ box, type _10_ to create a 10% discount.
5. Specify _April 30_ as the _Expiry Date_.
6. Click _Save Coupon_.
7. Notice the new coupon is now on the list of coupons.
8. Return to the shopping cart and refresh the page if needed.
9. Type _hype_ into the _Enter Coupon Code_ box and click _Apply_.
10. The confirmation appears and note that it updates the listed prices rather than showing up as a subtraction from the subtotal.

By the way, only one discount can be applied per checkout. If you try one discount and then want to try a different one, you are out of luck. Not the best user experience, but it is a very simple plugin.
