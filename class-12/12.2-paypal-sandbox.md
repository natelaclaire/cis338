# 12.2 Setting Up Your PayPal Sandbox Account

In order to test our shop using _PayPal Sandbox_ accounts, we are going to create a free _PayPal Developer_ account.

2. Click _Sign Up_ and then create an account.
3. You are automatically in _Sandbox Mode_. Scroll down and click _Sandbox Accounts_.
4. On this screen, you can see the two sandbox accounts that have been created for you. One is a business account that you will connect to _WordPress Simple Shopping Cart_ and the other is a personal account that you will use to make test purchases.
5. Click on the business account email address and then copy it from the next screen.
6. Return to the _WordPress Admin area_ and click _Simple Cart > Settings_.
