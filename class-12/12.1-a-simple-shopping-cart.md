# 12.1 A Simple Shopping Cart

Setting up an ecommerce site is a big topic. In fact, we have an entire course about it - CIS 438, which has in the past used a WordPress plugin called WooCommerce and which we expect will use the cloud-based Shopify ecommerce platform next time it is offered. Fortunately, selling a few things on your WordPress site is quite simple thanks to plugins combined with payment platforms such as PayPal and Stripe. This week, we will use a plugin called _WordPress Simple Shopping Cart_, which is very well named!

1. From the _Admin area_ of your _Tutorial Site_, go to _Plugins > Add New Plugin_.
2. Search for _WordPress Simple Shopping Cart_ and install and activate the plugin by _Tips and Tricks HQ, Ruhul Amin, mra13_.
