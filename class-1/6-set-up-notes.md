# Set up (SSH and phpMyAdmin)

By now, you should have an SFTP client and an SSH client installed and should have logged into your CIS Student Server account at least once, either as part of this lesson or in a previous course.

Next up, we are going to create a "cis338" directory under the "www" directory in your CIS Student Server account.

Then you'll use your MySQL credentials and make sure that you can sign into phpMyAdmin on the CIS Student Server.

Once you are done with these steps, complete this quiz to share the name of your SFTP and SSH clients, your success creating your course folder on the CIS Student Server, and your success logging into phpMyAdmin.

Finally, complete this week's discussion post: Tell the class a little about yourself. Please include: WordPress and other web design/development experience, why you are taking the class, and your interests.
