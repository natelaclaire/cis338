## 1.3 Installing and Using Local for WordPress Development

In this video, we’re going to look at the tool we’ll be using this semester to build our WordPress sites. The tool is called [**Local**](https://localwp.com/), and it’s created by the same company that runs [**WP Engine**](https://wpengine.com/).

WP Engine is a commercial WordPress hosting provider. They were one of the first hosts to focus entirely on WordPress and to tune their servers specifically for it. Unlike general web hosts that try to pack as many sites and services as possible onto a single server, WP Engine focuses only on WordPress. They don’t provide email hosting, for example. Their entire platform is designed around running WordPress well.

Local is a **free development tool** from WP Engine, and it’s what we’ll use to build our WordPress sites this semester.

### Why We’re Using Local

When you’re developing a WordPress site, you don’t always want—or have the ability—to put it on a live server. Running WordPress locally on your own computer is often easier and safer during development.

One thing I really like about Local is how simple the workflow is. You start your site when you want to work on it, and when you’re done for the day, you stop it. When the site stops, the database is saved as a SQL file alongside the rest of the site files. That means you can easily zip up the entire site and move it somewhere else, submit it for grading, or migrate it to a server later.

We’ll be using Local throughout the semester, so this is a good opportunity to learn a solid WordPress development workflow.

### Downloading Local

Local is completely free. The “Download for free” button is not marketing language—it really is free. WP Engine funds it by using it as a gateway to their paid hosting products, but you can use Local without paying anything.

Click **Download for Free**, then choose your platform. Local runs on macOS (both Intel and Apple Silicon), Windows, and Linux. I’m using Windows in this demo.

You don’t need to enter your name if you don’t want to. You will need to enter an email address. You can use your `maine.edu` address or any other address you prefer. Then click **Get It Now**.

Local is a fairly large download because it includes everything needed to run WordPress locally, so it may take a few minutes.

### Installing Local

Once the download finishes, run the installer.

On Windows, you’ll be asked whether to install Local just for yourself or for all users on the computer. If you’re on a work computer without administrative permissions, choose “only for me.” Otherwise, either option is fine.

Finish the installation and launch Local.

### Touring the Local Interface

When you first open Local, you won’t see any sites yet. I already had Local installed, so my previous sites appear here.

Down the side, you’ll see several sections:

* **Local Sites** – where your WordPress sites live
* **Blueprints** – saved site templates you can reuse
* **Add-ons** – extra features, some of which require an account
* **Account** – optional login for WP Engine services

Some features, like Live Links or cloud backups, require a free account, but we won’t be using those. You do *not* need to create an account to use Local for this course.

### Creating a New Site

To add a site, click the **plus (+)** button at the bottom.

Choose **Create a new site**, then click **Continue**.

Enter your site name. For this course, use:

```
Geekaway – Your Last Name
```

Using your last name is important so I can easily tell sites apart when you submit them.

You can open **Advanced Options** if you want to change the local domain or file location, but for now, leave everything as-is and click **Continue**.

### Choosing the Environment

Next, you’ll choose the environment—this controls the software versions used to run WordPress.

The **Preferred** option is fine:

* PHP 8.2
* Nginx web server
* MySQL 8

You *can* customize this if you know what you’re doing, but for this course, stick with the default and click **Continue**.

### WordPress Setup

Now you’ll enter your WordPress login details.

* Choose your own **username**
* Choose your own **password**
* Enter any email address

This information is just for you. I don’t need it, and we’ll talk later in the semester about how I’ll access your site when needed.

You’ll see an option under **Advanced Options** for **WordPress Multisite**. Leave this unchecked. We’ll briefly discuss multisite later in the course.

Click **Add Site**.

Local will now:

* Download WordPress
* Set up the database
* Start the web server

You may see a firewall or security prompt. Allow access so Local can run properly.

### Accessing Your Site

Once setup is complete, your site will start automatically.

You’ll see buttons to:

* Open the site
* Open the WordPress admin
* Stop the site

By default, the site uses an unsecured local URL. Since the site runs only on your computer, this isn’t a big deal, but Local includes built-in SSL support.

Click **Trust** to trust the local certificate, then switch to the secure URL. I recommend doing this so your site behaves more like a real production site.

### Helpful Tools in Local

Some useful features you’ll see:

* **One-click Admin** – logs you into WordPress automatically
* **Open Site** – opens the front page
* **Site Folder** – opens the WordPress files on your computer
* **Site Shell** – access to the WordPress command line (we’ll cover this later)
* **Open in VS Code** – opens the site in Visual Studio Code if installed

You can also open **Adminer**, a database management tool, to view WordPress database tables. By default, they use the `wp_` prefix. We’ll talk more about that later.

### MailPit (Local Email)

Local includes a tool called **MailPit**, which captures all outgoing WordPress emails.

If you open MailPit, you’ll see the email WordPress automatically sends after installation. This is where password resets and other emails go during development.

This is useful because:

* Emails don’t hit spam filters
* No SMTP setup is required
* Nothing gets sent to real email addresses

On a live server, email should be configured properly. For development, MailPit is exactly what we want.

### Starting and Stopping Sites

When your site is running, you’ll see a **Stop Site** button. You can also stop all sites at once.

When you’re done working for the day:

* Stop the site (or all sites)
* Close Local

Once Local is closed, the site is no longer accessible—even if browser tabs are still open.

Local only runs when you open it, and it shuts everything down cleanly when you’re done.

### Wrap-Up

That’s a quick overview of Local and how we’ll use it this semester. We’ll explore more features as we go, but this is all you need to get started.

If you run into any issues installing or using Local, or if something doesn’t behave as expected, let me know. I’m looking forward to using this tool with you this semester.
