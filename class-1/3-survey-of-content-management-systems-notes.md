# Survey of Content Management Systems

## Foreword

For most of this course, we will be focusing on the practical: creating a Web site using the WordPress content management system (CMS). Today, though, we are going to take a broader view of the various content management systems available and also discuss some terminology and theory that will help us to better understand why WordPress does things the way that it does.

## Definitions

- **Content** - According to Deane (pronounced "d EE n") Barker in his book **Web Content Management: Systems, Features, and Best Practices**, content is created by humans using an "editorial process" and is intended to be consumed by humans after publication to an audience. The editorial process is subjective, so two teams producing, for example, news articles based on the same data will never create the exact same articles. The editorial process is also iterative, generally requiring multiple refinements and modifications. The published content may be reused, repurposed, reevaluted, and consumed in various ways for years to come - thus "content is an investment in the future, not a record of the past."
- **Content Management System** - According to Barker, a CMS is "a software package that provides some level of automation for the tasks required to effectively manage content." This can include creating, editing, publishing, and other tasks related to content. Where the content is stored (the "repository"), where it is published, and how it is edited may be autonomous parts, but we generally consider them part of the system.
- **Content Management** *Discipline* - The discipline of content management is made up of theories, best practices, and accepted patterns. It transcends any specific CMS, which is a tool meant to assist in the theoretical idea of content management. Consequently, while learning how to use a specific CMS might not instantly enable one to use any CMS, the underlying concepts will be transferable and that means that learning a second CMS will be easier than the first.

## Types of Content Management Systems

- **Web content management (WCM)** - these systems manage content intended for publication on a Web site - *this is the focus of this course*
- **Enterprise content management (ECM)** - sometimes called "document management," these systems store business content that may not be published externally, such as incident reports, memos, and other internal documents
- **Digital asset management (DAM)** - used for managing digital assets such as images, audio, and video
- **Records management (RM)** - manages transactional information and other records that are byproducts of business operations, such as sales records, contracts, etc.
- **Learning management systems (LMS)** - manages learning resources and student interactions - Brightspace is an example of an LMS
- **Portals** - aggregates multiple streams of information (such as from multiple types of CMSs) into a unified system - the MyCampus portal is an example

The lines are very blurry. There are many systems that are classified as one of these but can also serve as another. For example, WordPress is a Web content management system but has plugins that enable it to provide many LMS functions. Additionally, many CMSs interact with other types of CMSs. For example, you might be able to access a DAM system from a Web CMS to find media content and publish it to the Web. Or, you might have an ECM that can push documents to a Web CMS for publication, such as an annual fiscal report that is maintained in the ECM during drafting, editing, and approval processes and then published to a Web site once approved.

## What Does A CMS Do?

- **Control / Keep Track Of Content** - for example, it controls who can see the content, records the state of the content, keeps track of how the content has changed, knows what content is related to what other content, and enables us to search and organize the content
- **Allow Content Reuse** - such as storing an author bio that can be updated in one place and the changes will be reflected at the bottom of all of the author's articles, providing teasers for related articles, etc.
- **Allow Content Automation and Aggregation** - such as providing content via a mobile app in addition to a Web site, providing a feed that can allow content to be promoted on a third party web site, providing abstracts of new content that can be sent in a daily e-newsletter, compiling a set of articles into an ebook or PDF, or managing multiple translations of content
- **Increase Editorial Efficiency** - by controlling the types of content that editors can and can't add, the formatting tools they can use, how the content is structured, automating the editorial workflow and collaboration, automating the publication/distribution process, etc.

## What A CMS Doesn't Do

- **Create Content** - it won't write your content or ensure that your content is good
- **Create Marketing Plans** - the CMS can help with the plan once defined, but a human has to define it
- **Effectively Format Content** - human editors must understand how much bold and italic is too much, when and how to align content, proper hyperlinking practices, proper image placement, etc.
- **Provide Governance** - it can enforce governance and workflow once defined, but humans must provide the instructions
