# 13.2 Finishing and Testing, Part 2

Continuing where we left off, let's scroll back up to the top of the page. Notice if we hover over _Activities_ we see our two categories of activities? Well, we want people to click one of the categories, not the main link, but there's no reason that people can't click the main link. We could solve this by using _Javascript_ to prevent the link from taking people anywhere, or by removing the URL from the main link altogether; however, search engines prefer that if we have a hierarchy implied by our URL structure, we should have a page at each level of the hierarchy. In this case, because we have _tutorial/activities/geeky/_ we should also have a valid, usable page at _tutorial/activities/_. So, let's do that.

1. Click _Activities_.
2. Click _Edit Page_ on the _Admin bar_.
3. Add 50/50 columns.
4. In the first column, add a _Cover_ block for _Geeky Activities_, use an appropriate image, and link it to the _Geeky Activities_ page.
5. In the second column, add a _Cover_ block for _Normie Activities_, use an appropriate image, and link it to the _Normie Activities_ page.
6. Set a _Featured Image_ for the page as well.
7. Click _Update_.

Return to the site and test our the new page and then proceed to test the two subpages. Of course, if this was a real site there is more that we would need to do here, but rather than waste our time repeating the same steps over and over again, we are going to move on. As you proceed through the remaining pages, you will see that there are other pages that need featured images set. Again, I won't make you do that, but it's definitely something you would want to fix if this were a real site.

The _Events_ page has a lot of functionality. In a real site, you would want to carefully test all of that functionality, including things like subscribing to feeds and buying tickets. Of course, you've already done that, so why do it again now? As you build a site, you sometimes install plugins that interact (perhaps unintentionally) with other plugins and once you get everything set up, you want to make sure that nothing you added after you tested something messed it up. For example, what if the shopping cart plugin messed up the events plugin? The _Events_ page might mostly work but maybe it doesn't accept RSVP's. You'll only know if you test again.

The _Blog_ page has a search form. Nowhere else on your site is there a search tool and if you test it you'll notice that the search tool searches all pages, not just blog posts. Although we won't do it for this site, search tools are frequently quite useful. You can add a _Search_ block to a navigation bar or anywhere else on your site. If you want to modify the search results page, you would modify the _Search Results_ template using the _Full Site Editor_. The results appear in a _Query Loop_ block, so editing the search results template is similar to what we did when we edited the _Blog_ template.
