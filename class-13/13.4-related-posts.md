# 13.4 Related Posts

I'd like to share just a little bit about cross-promoting blog posts. We use tags and categories to group posts, so if someone is interested in something that you write, they may simply click the category or a tag to view other similar posts. Or, they may click your name to view other things that you have written.

That's great, but what if you want to provide even more relevant content recommendations? Well, there's a plugin for that. You've probably seen on blog and news sites a section at the bottom of a post or story that shows _Related Stories_ or _Related Posts_, similar to what we have here. If you search in the _WordPress Plugin Gallery_ for _related posts_, you'll find numerous plugins that will automatically place links to related posts, often including featured image thumbnails, at the bottom of each post. Some of these rely on categories and tags, others analyze the post bodies and titles. Another differentiator is that some provide more flexibility regarding how and where the related posts are displayed.

Since we only have 2 blog posts, we're not going to install and use one of these, but I wanted to get you thinking about the possibilities.
