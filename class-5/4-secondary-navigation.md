# Secondary Navigation

In the last tutorial, I discussed that some classic themes support multiple menus. What I failed to mention, though, is that, as you might expect, FSE themes can define multiple menus *and* you can define your own menus as well.

The Kaaryam theme actually provides a secondary menu location in the site footer. Let's take a look at how we would populate that. First, though, let's publish the Privacy Policy page that is sitting in a draft state. We'll fill it out later. To do that, go to _All Pages_ in the _Admin area_ and publish the Privacy Policy page.

Next, go to _Appearance > Editor_. Notice the message about template parts being found under Patterns? We are looking for the footer template part, so click _Patterns_. Then find the _Footer_ template part and open it.

You should see an empty navigation bar. Click on that and create a new menu. Add the Privacy Policy page to it.

You don't need to follow along with this part, but I also want to show that you can add additional menus. If I click elsewhere in the footer and add a block, I can choose _Navigation_. I then have the ability to add another menu or use one of the existing ones.
